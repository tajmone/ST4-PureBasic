# About

This is my personal fork of [Peter Thomas Horn]'s package, _for personal use_.
Unlike Peter's upstream project, which is [enlisted at Package Control], this fork _will not_ be submitted to [Package Control].


# Installing

:no_entry: **_Don't!_** :no_entry:

Use Peter's [original package] instead, which can be installed via [Package Control] directly from within Sublime Text.


# Contributing

:no_entry: **_Don't!_** :no_entry:

I manage this project erratically in my free time, I don't have extra time to dedicate to managing third party contributions.

If you have useful contributions, submit them to Peter's [upstream project] instead — that's the main PureBasic package for Sublime Text, your contributions will benefit more end users.
